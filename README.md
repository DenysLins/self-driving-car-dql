## Introduction

In this project, we leverage the power of Deep Q-Learning, a model-free, online, off-policy reinforcement learning method, to train our self-driving car. Deep Q-Learning combines the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks with the power of Q-Learning, allowing our autonomous vehicle to make more informed decisions based on its environment.

## Prerequisites

- **Python:** We recommend using Python 3.8 or above.
- **Libraries:** This project heavily relies on the following Python libraries:
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
  - Kivy
  - Torch

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DenysLins/self-driving-car-dql.git

cd self-driving-car-dql
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional, but Recommended):**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Required Packages:**

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

```bash
python3 map.py
```

## Documentation

**Deep Q-Learning Implementation Details:** Deep Q-Learning uses a neural network, implemented in Torch, to approximate the Q-values. The network takes the state of our simulated environment as input and outputs Q-values for each action. During training, the car learns to update these Q-values based on rewards it receives from the environment, thus improving its driving strategy. More details about the implementation can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning#Deep_Q-learning).
